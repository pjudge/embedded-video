# embedded-video

A display mode must be created for remote videos. 
In this case it's called "embedded video."

The display mode will load a vimeo or yt thumbnail 
with a play icon on top (must be added to the theme).
When clicked, the thumbnail will be replaced by the appropriately
constructed iframe. 

This works with videos in the Drupal 8 media library.
